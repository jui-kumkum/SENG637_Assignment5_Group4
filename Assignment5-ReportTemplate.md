# Introduction
In this assignment,  we performed integration test data using some reliability assessment tools. We will explore the use of Reliability Growth Testing (RGT) and Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC) to assess the reliability of a software system.
Then we will compare these techniques to see what they are like and how they are different from one another.

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing (RGT)
For Reliability Growth Testing, after testing the tools suggested by the assignment guideline, we decided to utilize the tool C-SFRAT. The reason for choosing C-SFRAT is because the tool has a very user-friendly way to install and to compare the models with different combinations of covariates.

For C-SFRAT, our approach was to first run the entire failure data set that we were given with every model and covariate combination possible, and then determine which model is suitable for the behavior of the failure data according to some metric such as AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) and SSE (Sum of Squared Errors).
